## Business Problem
This project deals with the Gett data to find insights about
orders getting failed and finding any patterns about failed orders.

whether they are cancelled by customer or system.

## Insights Gained
- No driver assigned, client cancelled order has most no of 
combinations followed by No driver assigned, system Reject 
followed by Driver assigned, client cancelled.
- At around 8 in the morning, most orders get failed.
- The average time to cancellation is higher on orders with 
an assigned driver than without, for each hour without exception.
 The peak occurs at 3 A.M. At this time there are a lot of client
  cancellations, so a logical explanation would be that clients
   have waited too long for the driver.
